1.40    Fri Apr 12 20:49:50 EDT 2002
	* Minor documentation fixes.
	* Patch file now fixes a host of small display problems in bioperl 1.0
1.39	Fri Apr 12 00:18:10 EDT 2002
	* Fixed problems compiling and installing on Solaris systems.
	* Added the wormbase_gene aggregator.  Useful for the c. elegans gff file.
	* If you pick up the latest bioperl-live (or apply extras/bioperl-1.0.patch)
	there are fixes in Bio::Graphics that prevent genes from disappearing
	when zoomed all the way into an intron.
1.38	Mon Apr  8 21:16:12 EDT 2002
	* Previous version would crash on vanilla Bioperl 1.0 installations.
	  This problem has been fixed, but at the cost of disabling wildcard
	  searches.  To get wildcard searches, upgrade to Bioperl 1.01 using
	  CVS or the patch file in extras/bioperl-1.0.patch.
	* Fixed aesthetic problems with a phantom "plugin:Restriction Sites"
	  entry appearing on the key even when restriction sites are turned
 	  off.
	* Fixed intermittent "Couldn't open database" errors.
	* Fixed intermittent scrambling of user settings.
