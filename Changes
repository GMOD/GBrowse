1.70
        * Bug fixes for the Chado adapter, including improving wildcard
          searching and fixing a bug that caused ALL features on a reference
          sequence to be returned when the segment was at the beginning of
          the reference sequence.
	* Fixed Galaxy support bug which caused prevented features from multiple
	  tracks being selected.
	* Fixed problem with feature highlighting which caused highlighting to get "stuck"

          from true region.
	* Silenced log file warnings when inkscape isn't present.
        * Added "merge searches" option to turn merging of similarly-named features 
	  on and off.
        * Moved Bio::DB::Das::Chado and BDD::BioSQL to their own packages and
          out of the GBrowse distribution so they can be updated independently via CPAN
        * Fixed encoding of version number at the bottom of the page.

1.69

	  section as a convenience.
	* Fixed cross-site scripting vulnerability.


1.68
        * Added patched copy of Bio::Graphics::FeatureFile that fixes bug in the display of groups.
          Remember to remove this file when bioperl 1.5.3 is out.
        * Added support to Chado adapter for feature.is_obsolete column:
            now, unless the -allow_obsolete flag is used, obsoleted features
            will not appear in GBrowse displays
	* Documentation updates
	* "universal" net installer now lives in bin/gbrowse_netinstall.pl
	* Updated GuessDirectories.pm for Ubuntu

1.67
        * Added patch from Steve Taylor that allows one to group track labels into
          a pretty MxN table.
	* Fixed problems with displaying remote DAS tracks which
	  manifested itself as links not working correctly.

1.66    * Added files from SynView to the contrib directory; these files
          include a GUSdb adaptor and configuration files and sample
          data for a 'in-gbrowse' synteny viewer.
        * Added support to Chado adaptor to respect the reference class
          in the conf file (previously, the adaptor would infer the
          reference class from the database structure).  If the 
          reference class is not provided in the database, the old
          behavior still works. Thanks to Emmanuel Quevillon for
          the patch that implements this change.
        * Improved support in Chado adaptor for inferring CDS and UTR
          features from exons and polypeptides (at the expense of speed).
        * Added support to the Chado adaptor for showing alignments with
          sequence residues in the display panel as well as gbrowse_details.

	  in some genetic maps.
	* Added fixes to GFF.pm for GFF3 to BioPerl patches
	* Fix the way that plugins are stored in mod_perl environment to prevent them from
	  appearing and disappearing haphazardly when switching between sources.
        * Added a trace glyph
        * Several fixes to the Chado adaptor, mostly to keep up with changes
          to APIs

	* Added Russian and Polish language translations
        * Fixed chado adaptor bug for older chado databases with both 
          SO and SOFA loaded

	* Added the ability to highlight multiple sequence regions using URL arguments.
	* Added the ability to turn off the autosearch feature which restores the previous
	        region when the user revisits the browser.
	* Added sections on grouping tracks by category, defining
	        region panels, and loading Berkeleydb databases to tutorial.
        * Added a "hide" option to use when semantic zooming should turn a track
                off altogether.
	* Added README-lucegene.pod, describing the Lucegene GFF adaptor
	* The link option in the config file can now be used to override the built-in linking
		rules from DAS sources.
	* Moved plugins menu to a more prominent position.
	* Uploaded features can now be placed in details panel, overview panel, or both panels.
	* init_code subroutines and anonymous callbacks are now placed in the same package so that
		one can refer to the other.
	* The feature name search now no longer does a wildcard PREFIX search (*foo*), which was killing
		performance. It still does a wildcard SUFFIX search (foo*).
	* You can now use the parameters "enable" and "disable" to
		selectively open or close a set of tracks without blowing
		away the settings for all the other tracks the way "label" does.
        * gbrowse_img now takes a "highlight" parameter that will highlight the indicated
                named feature(s) in yellow.
	* gbrowse_details will now evaluate URL options expressed as anonymous subroutines (contributed
		by Cyril Pommier).
	* gbrowse_details now accepts a general formatting rule syntax
		that allows the formatting of each tag value to be precisely
		controlled.
        * Changed mainform submission method from POST to GET when MSIE detected,
                in order to defeat evil "cache has expired" message. This hack is
		under the control of the "msie hack" option, and is false by default.

	* Added request timeout option for very long requests.
	* Added additional padding to prevent scales of xyplot glyph from being
	cut off.
	* Added ability to search within external annotation files for uploaded
	features.  You will need to CVS update bioperl-live to get this feature.
	* Fixed problem of external annotation files disappearing.
	* Fixed the problem of three-frame translation glyph showing wrong
	translation.  HOWEVER, for the [x]flip feature to work properly,
        you will need to CVS update bioperl-live.
	* Fixed the problem of segments shrinking by 1 bp when the starting
	segment length was an odd number.
	* Fixed problem of gbrowse_img consuming all available memory
	when displaying 3d party features in absolute coordinates.

        URLs to corresponding cmap features

1.61    Wed Mar 17 21:59:16 EST 2004
        * Moved the BioSQL adaptor to 'experimental'.  It is not guaranteed
        to work.
        * Really fixed the landmark problem (the 1.60 release was premature)
	* Quashed warnings from the GeneFinder plugin
	* Suppress warnings generated by coderefs in the link and window_target
	options.  See make_map() to turn this back on - it might not be the 
	greatest idea to turn off warnings

1.60	Tue Mar 16 16:36:45 EST 2004
	* Fixed problem of some landmarks not being recognized using 
	the Class:Name syntax.

        is the minimum version of GD required.
        * Added the ability to modify html display via callbacks utilizing
        segment and page setting objects.
        * Fixed alignment problems in gbrowse_details

	authentication/authorization techniques.
	* Default time for cookie expiration reduced to 7 days.  This will avoid
	issues arising from previous change.
	* Added mechanisms to restrict individual tracks by username and
        password
	or by host, domain, or IP address.
        * Fixed ppm install utility script
        * Updated documentation to reflect the new GET syntax
        * Fixed sequence alignments in gbrowse_details when there are minus
        strand sequences.

1.55
        * Removed hard coded paths in install scripts
	* Auto-open tracks that contain matches to the search term.  This avoids
	nasty behavior in which someone searches for "collagen" and never sees
	what it was that matched.
	* Support for highlighting the matched feature in yellow.  Highlighted
	feature is persistent across sessions (may annoy people - consider
	a selectable option)
	* Support for a "highlight" plugin class which will highlight features
	based on matching attributes or other queries.

1.47 	Tue Oct  8 14:44:44 EDT 2002
	* Bug fix release.
	* Fixed source sorting so that lowest alphabetically-sorted
	  configuration file is accepted by default.  Otherwise,
	  the default is BioSQL, which is not installed on most
	  machines and causes an internal server error.
	* Fixed the plugins so that they are not turned on by default.
	* Changed the default empty track style from "suppress" to "key."

	there are fixes in Bio::Graphics that prevent genes from disappearing
	when zoomed all the way into an intron.
1.38	Mon Apr  8 21:16:12 EDT 2002
	* Previous version would crash on vanilla Bioperl 1.0 installations.
