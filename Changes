        * Added a track filtering ability via plugins.
	* Fixed FastCGI support so that changes to GBROWSE_CONF are recognized each time
	  the FastCGI server runs. This allows you to change GBROWSE_CONF on a per-directory
          basis using <Location> and SetEnv.
1.993   * Fixed bug in the cache expiration code that caused cache time to be set
	  abnormally low and prevented cached data from being cached.

          to contain any features in current view to remain greyed out

1.90    * server farm rearchitecture introduced
	* big cleanup of defunct files; migrating to Module::Build

1.67    * Templates now the norm, use gbrowse_not to get the "no templates" version.

	        region panels, and loading Berkeleydb databases to tutorial.
        * Added a "hide" option to use when semantic zooming should turn a track
                off altogether.
	* Added README-lucegene.pod, describing the Lucegene GFF adaptor
	* The link option in the config file can now be used to override the built-in linking
		rules from DAS sources.
	* Moved plugins menu to a more prominent position.

		performance. It still does a wildcard SUFFIX search (foo*).
	* You can now use the parameters "enable" and "disable" to
		selectively open or close a set of tracks without blowing
		away the settings for all the other tracks the way "label" does.
        * gbrowse_img now takes a "highlight" parameter that will highlight the indicated
                named feature(s) in yellow.

		that allows the formatting of each tag value to be precisely
		controlled.
        * Changed mainform submission method from POST to GET when MSIE detected,
                in order to defeat evil "cache has expired" message. This hack is

	segment length was an odd number.
	* Fixed problem of gbrowse_img consuming all available memory
	when displaying 3d party features in absolute coordinates.

        URLs to corresponding cmap features

1.61    Wed Mar 17 21:59:16 EST 2004
        * Moved the BioSQL adaptor to 'experimental'.  It is not guaranteed
        to work.
        * Really fixed the landmark problem (the 1.60 release was premature)
	* Quashed warnings from the GeneFinder plugin
	* Suppress warnings generated by coderefs in the link and window_target
	options.  See make_map() to turn this back on - it might not be the 
	greatest idea to turn off warnings

1.60	Tue Mar 16 16:36:45 EST 2004
	* Fixed problem of some landmarks not being recognized using 
	the Class:Name syntax.

        * Fixed bug with link URL when the same feature type occurred in more
        than one track
        * Added SVG "Publication quality image" option; as a result, GD 2.07
        is the minimum version of GD required.
        * Added the ability to modify html display via callbacks utilizing
        segment and page setting objects.
        * Fixed alignment problems in gbrowse_details

	authentication/authorization techniques.
	* Default time for cookie expiration reduced to 7 days.  This will avoid
	issues arising from previous change.
	* Added mechanisms to restrict individual tracks by username and
        password
	or by host, domain, or IP address.
        * Fixed ppm install utility script
        * Updated documentation to reflect the new GET syntax
        * Fixed sequence alignments in gbrowse_details when there are minus
        strand sequences.

1.55
        * Removed hard coded paths in install scripts
	* Auto-open tracks that contain matches to the search term.  This avoids
	nasty behavior in which someone searches for "collagen" and never sees
	what it was that matched.
	* Support for highlighting the matched feature in yellow.  Highlighted
	feature is persistent across sessions (may annoy people - consider
	a selectable option)
	* Support for a "highlight" plugin class which will highlight features
	based on matching attributes or other queries.

1.54	Thu Aug 28 12:08:15 EDT 2003

1.47 	Tue Oct  8 14:44:44 EDT 2002
	* Bug fix release.
	* Fixed source sorting so that lowest alphabetically-sorted
	  configuration file is accepted by default.  Otherwise,
	  the default is BioSQL, which is not installed on most
	  machines and causes an internal server error.
	* Fixed the plugins so that they are not turned on by default.
	* Changed the default empty track style from "suppress" to "key."
	* Better error reporting.

	there are fixes in Bio::Graphics that prevent genes from disappearing
	when zoomed all the way into an intron.
1.38	Mon Apr  8 21:16:12 EDT 2002
	* Previous version would crash on vanilla Bioperl 1.0 installations.
