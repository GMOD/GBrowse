2.16
     * Added code to recognize and strip whitespace from search coordinates. This 
       allows "chr1:2,000 .. 1,180,000" to work as a search term.
     * Added code that allows callbacks to invoke Bio::Graphics::Browser2::Render->request()
       in order to get a hash that contains various information about the current state.
       Interesting keys include: search_str, ref, start, end, flip, tracks, features, userid, uploadid,
       h_feat, width, grid. (NOTE: please update documentation WIKI with some explanation of how to use this).
     * Disable track filters when in summary mode, since the summary features generated when this
       mode is active rarely have the structure and attributes expected by the writer of the filter.
       The downside of this is that if you use track filters to distinguish one set of features from
       another, this will not be reflected in the summary density plots, which will show all features
       of the matching type regardless of the filter.
     * Basic support for Google federated login via openid.
     * "unit label" and "unit divider" should now work as advertised.
     * Add commas to coordinates more liberally.
     * Maybe fixed failing t/00.compile.t test.
     * Fixed problem with subtrack selection tables producing empty tracks under some conditions.

2.15 Mon Sep 13 11:22:40 EDT 2010
     * Set the "DNA accessor" for databases to the default database. Assuming that the backend supports
       the dna_accessor() method and that the default database has access to the underlying sequence, then
       this will enable glyphs and plugins to access the DNA for all features, even if the feature is contained
       in a database that does not have access to the DNA.
     * You can now override the "buttons" images path in individual datasource files.
     * You can now have an annotator plugin turned on by default by specifying it in the "default
       features" option using the syntax "plugin:RestrictionAnnotator".
     * Renderfarm slaves now honor the init_code directive. You will need Bio::Graphics version 2.13
       in order to take advantage of this feature.
     * Added a description of the BED file format to the upload help page.
     * Fixed various problems in the ProteinDumper plugin.
     * Fixed problems with all regular expression tracks being cached to same directory.
     * Fixed issues with uploaded tracks not being displayed when renderfarm activated.
     * Fixed issues involving failure of render slaves to preload databases (slowing everything down).
     * Fixed incorrect sequence dumping in the sequence dumper when using the 
       Bio::DB::GFF database backend.
     * Fixed problems with losing all default tracks when first loading the browser (this was a bug
       introduced in SVN and never released.)
     * You can now override the "buttons" images path in individual datasource files.

2.14 Fri Aug 27 11:05:08 EDT 2010
     * Prevent a blank-screen crash when searching for chromosomes not in the database.
     * Added a "hide empty subtracks" option to suppress subtrack display when there are
       no features in the region of interest. Note that if there are no features in any
       subtracks, the entire track will be empty regardless of the subtracks (this may or
       may not be a bug).
     * Fixed bug in TrackDumper plugin to prevent "Can't locate object method print_gff3" 
       error. Thanks to Prem Anand for the fix.
     * Fixed display problem in subtrack selection table when there are additional data row 
       elements that are not listed among the selection criteria.
     * Fixed TrackDumper routines to dump out both the tracks and signal from vista tracks.
     * Added CORS capabilities to DAS server so that javascript clients don't have to use a proxy.
     * Precompile glyphs used in each datasource in parent process so that each child doesn't have to
       recompile them.
     * Renamed all the "userdb*" options to "upload_db_*" to avoid confusion with user_account_db.
     * Fixed uploaded tracks mysql backend so that server logs in with correct username and password.
     * simplified custom tracks interface by removing separate section for "import tracks" and adding a 
       "From URL" link to the Upload Tracks section
     * 'eurl' parameter is now loaded asynchronously so that user can watch the process of the upload
       (useful from galaxy).
     * Fixed URL-based file uploads so that they work correctly even when the user has no session yet.
     * Added a datasource "seqid_prefix" option that allows you to add and strip "chr" style prefixes from all seqids;
       this allows for interoperability with UCSC, which always wants a "chr" to begin each chromosome.
     * Fixed loading of SAM files to avoid loading of incorrect fasta file when both .fa and .fa.fai files
       are present in the scaffolds directory.

2.13
     * Fixed SAM file processing so as not to die on first line of SAM @SQ header.
       This requires Bio::DB::Sam 1.20 to work properly.
     * Fixed upload listing table so as not to duplicate track labels.
     * Fixed track importation via the eurl parameter so that it works when the 
       user's uploadid is empty (due to clearing cache of cookies).
     * Fixed DAS server handling of the link option.

2.12 Wed Jun 30 15:28:16 EDT 2010
     * Fixed FASTA dumping due to typo introduced just prior to 2.11 release.

2.11 Mon Jun 28 11:42:02 EDT 2010
        * Fixed generation of mysql database names for user upload sets so that names do
	  not exceed mysql's limits.
	* Speeded up execution speed when configuration files get large (>1000 tracks).
	* DAS server and client now functional.
	* Reenabled the "eurl" parameter to link to a data set from the URL.
	* Added "Get chromosome sizes" entry to the File menu (requires a developer's snapshot of
	  bioperl to work with all data sources).
	* Fasta and GFF3 dumps working ok now.
	* You can now import a BigWig file by reference.
	* Uploaded WIG files will generate bigwig indexes if library is available.
	* action=scan now returns the category for each track.

2.10 Tue Jun 15 10:58:32 EDT 2010
        * Fully generalized subtrack creation.

2.09 Mon May 24 18:45:48 PDT 2010
	* To turn off caching of the config file (which is causing deparse errors for some
	  callbacks) set the environment variable GBROWSE_NOCACHE to a true value
	  (like "1" or "yes"). This must be done in the Apache config.
        * Fixed various bugs in the processing of SAM and BAM files.
	* BAM parser now creates BigWig indexes if library is available.
	* Fixed "no overloaded magic in Bio::DAS::Segment" error.
	* Made Menus and tabbed section labels larger (if you don't like, 
	  edit htdocs/css/dropdown/default-theme.css).
	* Moved track table into its own tabbed section.
	* TrackFinder plugin now hilights the matches in the track table.
	* New "subtrack table" and "subtrack select" options allow you to create nice
	  sortable tables of potential subtracks. The old "select" option is still
	  supported, but deprecated.
	* Added "kewl" blinds down effect when changing tabs.
	* Greatly improved track configuration.
	* From E.O. Stinson: added fixes for embedding GBrowse in other web pages.
	* From E.O. Stinson: Added support for regex-style datasources that let you define
	  one data source that will pass different options to a script-based config depending
	  on the URL.
	* From E.O. Stinson: Added a move_to_name function for navigating to a region in one step
	  via a URL call.

2.08 Thu May 20 22:46:13 EDT 2010
	* Added the ability to control the toggle state of each category and subcategory at
	  startup time by using the "category state" and "category default state" options
	  (see the GBROWSE2 HOWTO at http://gmod.org/wiki/GBrowse_2.0_HOWTO#Appearance_Settings)
	* Fixed searches on Bio::DB::GFF databases so that exact searches work again.
	* Fixed the busy spinner so that it doesn't stick in "on" state when region is empty
	  and user turns on tracks.

2.07 Mon May 17 10:27:56 EDT 2010
`    	* Tracked down the "let Lincoln know bug is not fixed" bug, and found a real solution.
	  This was happening when user presses "back" button on browser after an unsuccessful
	  search. This still triggers a log message until we know the bug is really and truly
	  fixed.
	* BAM track download now works properly under both FastCGI and mod_perl. mod_perl
	  download requires Bio-SamTools 1.19.
	* Requires Bio::Graphics version 2.09, which addresses a bug in which subroutines
	  defined in init_code could not be referenced within callbacks.

2.06    Thu May 13 17:10:59 EDT 2010
	* Fixed dangling references to GFFPrinter.pm module, which was renamed TrackDumper.pm
	* Requires Bio::Graphics version 2.08, in order to fix the init_code option, which stopped
	  working when config file caching was introduced in Bio::Graphics 2.07.
 
2.05	* Implemented a new caching scheme for communicating with renderfarm slaves. 
	  This will improve performance, but requires Bio::Graphics version 1.05.
        * Experimental local rendering code -- each track is rendered in a separate process.
	* Reverted to older versions of prototype and scriptaculous due to Google
	  Chrome incompatibilities.
	* Preferred way to separate labels is now to use the "l" option and separate
	  labels with "%1E", as in "l=mdc-1%1Esma-23%1Eunknown genes"
	* Work around race conditions in the 05.deferredrendering regression tests.
	  May still fail if system is under lots of load during test.
	* Fixed bug in change_track_order javascript that prevented track order change from
	  "sticking" when track labels contained underscores.
	* Download icons now selectively download GFF3, SAM or WIG data.
	* Early support for a "show_summary" option in [TRACK DEFAULTS] and [TRACK] stanzas. If this
	  is present and set to a length in bases, then when the user tries to display a region
	  larger than the length the track will display feature density instead. For this to
	  work, the database adaptor must support a feature_summary() method. This is being actively
	  worked on in bioperl, but is not currently available.
2.04    * Can set the subtracks to be displayed by default using the new "select default" option.
	* New syntax for select option:
          select   = type ;
	        dpy-27 'dpy-27 chip'   =101;
                htz-1  'htz-1 chip'    =102;
                pol2   'polymerase II' =103;
                sdc-3  'sdc-3 chip'    =104;
          Everything following the = sign is an optional comment (modencode uses it for the submission ID).
	  The old syntax for this still works.
	* Added a TrackFinder plugin which will limit tracks according to their key,
	  citation, or "keywords" option, based on keyword matches the user types in.
	* Prevent gbrowse_img zombie processes from accumulating under FastCGI.
	* Generate correct Galaxy callback URL and inhibit menu item when Galaxy not configured.
	* OligoFinder plugin now works with gbrowse2.
	* Updated js libraries to prototype 1.6.1 and scriptaculous 1.8.3.
2.03    * GBrowse_details: display of aligned sequences improved.
	* Can now paste remote BAM URLs into "import a track" field.
	* Private (authenticated) sessions never expire.
	* Fixed bug that led to a keyword search always returning multiple hits
	* Added a scalebar on top of the details ruler.
        * Fixed bug in installation paths of example databases (rbuels)
        * Bugfix to support for subroutines in user-defined 'head' configuration options (rbuels)
	* Bug fix to avoid hitting database each time the client checks on the status of a render request.
	* Bug fix to treat timed-out cache operations the same as timed-out render operations.
	* Bug fix to interrupt long system operations, like MySQL queries.
2.02    * Sheldon McKay rolled gbrowse_syn back into gbrowse2
	* Fixed bug in parsing of configuration lines from cut-and-paste uploads
	* Added ability to look at current session's user and upload IDs.
	* Track dumper now accepts option to dump all chromosomes; however only works with
	  local databases.
	* Fixed display of hard-clipped sequences in gbrowse_details.
	* Added a spinner that displays when tracks are updating.
	* Fixed appearance of subtrack selector.
2.01    * Fixed "multiple segment" exception in gbrowse_detail.
	* gbrowse_details now draws alignments correctly when both reference and target
	  report "-" strand. This happens in samtools.
	* Fixed default location of users sqlite database; it now lives in /var/www/gbrowse2/databases
	* Fixed SMTP configuration for login script so that unencrypted connections to gateway now
	  work.
2.00    * The "admin" user can upload public tracks. Use gbrowse_set_admin_passwd.pl to
	  initialize the account.
	* If session arguments not specified in GBrowse.conf, software will pick the fastest
	  version.
        * Brought tutorial into synch with new features and syntax.
        * "Build demo" now works correctly.
        * Install registration feature activated.
1.9990  * Re-added the ability to group tracks into NxM tables.
	* Fixed bug in which database ID was not filled in on the clickable imagemap when
	  multiple features are shown.
	* Implemented the Finder plugin interface.
	* Balloon popups now work when gbrowse_img is embedded (from Xiaoqi Shi's patch).
	* Fixed track sharing client functionality.
1.9984  * gbrowse_img now shows karyotype display when multiple regions are selected.
	* Fixed install paths and verified that you can install into home directory.
1.9983  * Not released.
1.9982  * Undid some of the damage left by the upload code cleanup.
	* Can now upload gzipped and bzipp2ed files for all file types.
	* SAM and BAM file uploading supported, provided Bio::DB::BAM library is installed
	  and there is a suitable FASTA file for the reference genome in one of the tracks.
1.9981  * The old-style upload code has been removed.
1.998   * WARNING: WIG FILE UPLOADING NOT WORKING.
	* New tabbed layout for browser, uploads & preferences.
	* Background uploading working well; will now resume automatically if window is closed and reopened.
	* Editing of uploaded files and config files now working properly.
1.9971  * Fixed bugs that were preventing name searches from working across BAM databases.
	* Fixed incorrect character sets returned from asynchronous calls.
	* Implemented asynchronous upload of files.
1.997   * Fixed bad bug in cookie handling that allowed cookies from one session to overwrite
	another when mod_perl or fastcgi in use.
	* Started working on redesign of data uploading and sharing.
1.996   * Add "feature_limit" option to keep very populous tracks under control.
	* Attempt to fix problem of FastCGI processes hanging around even after apache restarted.
	* Installer will no longer overwrite locally-modified configuration files.
	* Will now cache piped files and freshen cache at an interval set by "expire data sources".
1.995	* Install to an alternate location (e.g. home directory) by using --install_base argument when
	  calling perl Build.PL.
	* Don't overwrite user's configuration files when doing an upgrade install!
1.994   * Fixed another bug in the cache expiration code that was causing session information
	  to expire at end of user's browser session.
        * Added abiity to tag tracks by their "track source" and "data source" and to turn them
          on and off using this information.
        * Added a track filtering ability via plugins.
	* Fixed FastCGI support so that changes to GBROWSE_CONF are recognized each time
	  the FastCGI server runs. This allows you to change GBROWSE_CONF on a per-directory
          basis using <Location> and SetEnv.
1.993   * Fixed bug in the cache expiration code that caused cache time to be set
	  abnormally low and prevented cached data from being cached.
1.992   * Added the gbrowse_clean.pl script for cleaning up stale temp files
        * Normalized expiration and caching arguments.
1.991   * Added a variety of different session locking mechanisms after I discovered.
	  that flock doesn't always work across NFS-mounted file systems.
1.990   * Fixed bug in which the hilighting of features got "stuck" on beige.
	* Fixed bug in which changing the chromosome of a region but leaving 
	  the coordinates the same caused redisplay of the previous region.
1.989   * Another attempted fix of Galaxy problems. The galaxy_incoming option was not handled correctly.
	* Fix track dumping/sharing so that uploaded files are dumped/shared correctly.

1.988	* Fix handling of DBI databases so that various intermittent SQL errors ("server went away")
	  no longer occur.
	* Fixed Galaxy support to return correct MIME type. This
          should correct problems people have had with track data not
          loading into Galaxy.
        * fixed bug that was causing remote tracks that didn't happen
          to contain any features in current view to remain greyed out

1.90    * server farm rearchitecture introduced
	* big cleanup of defunct files; migrating to Module::Build

1.67    * Templates now the norm, use gbrowse_not to get the "no templates" version.
	* The das script now works (more or less) with Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store adaptor. Not tested
	with chado adaptor.

1.66    * The popup zoom menu will never show a region larger than the overview.
	* Fixed collapsible sections so that they store their state in transient named cookies
	  rather than in a single bit vector.

1.65	* Improved support for negative and fractional coordinates, such as those used
	  in some genetic maps.

1.64	* Revamped state handling to use CGI::Session instead of cookies
	* Added Russian and Polish language translations
        * Fixed chado adaptor bug for older chado databases with both 
          SO and SOFA loaded
	* Fixed bug to allow multple 'add' parameters 
	* Added an option to turn on and off the background grid.
	* Fixed extraneous redirect when calling gbrowse_img.

1.63
	* Added a new "region" panel which is intermediate in size between the overview
		and the detail panels. Thanks to Barry Healy for coding this. Use the new 
		"region segment" configuration option to turn this feature on.
	* Added ability to open and close sections with a JavaScript toggle.
	* Added ability to group tracks logically.
	* Added the "initial landmark" configuration option to bring up a 
		default region the first time user visits the web page.
	* Added the "quicklink plugins" option to add selected plugins to
		the links list underneath the instructions.
        * Added compatibility with mod_perl version 2 (via ModPerl::Registry)
	* Added the ability to highlight multiple features using URL arguments.
	* Added the ability to highlight multiple sequence regions using URL arguments.
	* Added the ability to turn off the autosearch feature which restores the previous
	        region when the user revisits the browser.
	* Added sections on grouping tracks by category, defining
	        region panels, and loading Berkeleydb databases to tutorial.
        * Added a "hide" option to use when semantic zooming should turn a track
                off altogether.
	* Added README-lucegene.pod, describing the Lucegene GFF adaptor
	* The link option in the config file can now be used to override the built-in linking
		rules from DAS sources.
	* Moved plugins menu to a more prominent position.
	* Uploaded features can now be placed in details panel, overview panel, or both panels.
	* init_code subroutines and anonymous callbacks are now placed in the same package so that
		one can refer to the other.
	* The feature name search now no longer does a wildcard PREFIX search (*foo*), which was killing
		performance. It still does a wildcard SUFFIX search (foo*).
	* You can now use the parameters "enable" and "disable" to
		selectively open or close a set of tracks without blowing
		away the settings for all the other tracks the way "label" does.
        * gbrowse_img now takes a "highlight" parameter that will highlight the indicated
                named feature(s) in yellow.
	* gbrowse_details will now evaluate URL options expressed as anonymous subroutines (contributed
		by Cyril Pommier).
	* gbrowse_details now accepts a general formatting rule syntax
		that allows the formatting of each tag value to be precisely
		controlled.
        * Changed mainform submission method from POST to GET when MSIE detected,
                in order to defeat evil "cache has expired" message. This hack is
		under the control of the "msie hack" option, and is false by default.

1.62    Mon Apr  5 09:43:25 EDT 2004
	* Added request timeout option for very long requests.
	* Added additional padding to prevent scales of xyplot glyph from being
	cut off.
	* Added ability to search within external annotation files for uploaded
	features.  You will need to CVS update bioperl-live to get this feature.
	* Fixed problem of external annotation files disappearing.
	* Fixed the problem of three-frame translation glyph showing wrong
	translation.  HOWEVER, for the [x]flip feature to work properly,
        you will need to CVS update bioperl-live.
	* Fixed the problem of segments shrinking by 1 bp when the starting
	segment length was an odd number.
	* Fixed problem of gbrowse_img consuming all available memory
	when displaying 3d party features in absolute coordinates.
	* Fixed problem of only one feature being found during wildcard search
	and identically-named matches are on different reference sequences.
	* Fixed problem of track settings disappearing when "update image" is
	pressed when the track checkboxes are hidden.
	* Fixed cross-site scripting bug (security hole) reported by Toshiaki
	Katayama.
	* Added a pairwise_plot glyph for showing linkage disequilibrium,
	paired blast scores, and other pairwise feature data.
	* Use can now turn on and off the overview tracks.
        * Fixed chado adaptor to properly render the gbrowse_details page.
        * Patch from Eric Just to eliminate unecessary URL arguments.
        * Fixes from Jack Chen to get colors in multiple alignments "just right."
        * Several fixes, improvements to the chado adaptor.
        * added code to the chado adaptor to allow it to generate
        URLs to corresponding cmap features

1.61    Wed Mar 17 21:59:16 EST 2004
        * Moved the BioSQL adaptor to 'experimental'.  It is not guaranteed
        to work.
        * Really fixed the landmark problem (the 1.60 release was premature)
	* Quashed warnings from the GeneFinder plugin
	* Suppress warnings generated by coderefs in the link and window_target
	options.  See make_map() to turn this back on - it might not be the 
	greatest idea to turn off warnings

1.60	Tue Mar 16 16:36:45 EST 2004
	* Fixed problem of some landmarks not being recognized using 
	the Class:Name syntax.

1.59    Mon Feb 16 13:56:46 EST 2004
        * Fixed security hole related to track level security
        * Fixed functioning related to arbitrary (non-base) units
        * Fixed a bug that caused hanging when fetching reference sequences
        * Updated BioSQL adaptor
        * Updated ImportFeatures.pm and ExportFeatures.pm to better support
          GFF3 and fascilitate Apollo import and export
        * Added support for 3rd party DAS anotations
        * Added a MOBY server 
        * Added a proof-of-concept filter module
        * added allele_tower glyph

1.58    Wed Dec 31 10:49:20 EST 2003
        * Fixed memory leak when used with mod_perl
        * Fixed bug with link URL when the same feature type occurred in more
        than one track
        * Added SVG "Publication quality image" option; as a result, GD 2.07
        is the minimum version of GD required.
        * Added the ability to modify html display via callbacks utilizing
        segment and page setting objects.
        * Fixed alignment problems in gbrowse_details
        * Fixed several items with the chado/gmod adaptor
        * Added documentation for installing on MacOSX
        * Added a simple MOBY browser (see CONFIGURE_HOWTO for configuring it).
        * Fixed a long pathname bug with the Windows PPM install.

1.57	Sat Oct  4 21:59:19 EDT 2003
	* Fixed formatting errors in gbrowse_details alignments.
	* Fixed bug in generation of interspersed HTML that prevented one from
	providing a code reference for the html1 option.
	* New idiogram glyph for putting images of Giemsa-stained chromosomes
	in the overview.
	* Added Icelandic translation
	* Updated French translation
	* GET syntax for invoking gbrowse now changed from 
	http://localhost/cgi-bin/gbrowse?source=yeast
	to 
	http://localhost/cgi-bin/gbrowse/yeast
	This will allow restriction by data sources using Apache's standard
	authentication/authorization techniques.
	* Default time for cookie expiration reduced to 7 days.  This will avoid
	issues arising from previous change.
	* Added mechanisms to restrict individual tracks by username and
        password
	or by host, domain, or IP address.
        * Fixed ppm install utility script
        * Updated documentation to reflect the new GET syntax
        * Fixed sequence alignments in gbrowse_details when there are minus
        strand sequences.

1.55
        * Removed hard coded paths in install scripts
	* Auto-open tracks that contain matches to the search term.  This avoids
	nasty behavior in which someone searches for "collagen" and never sees
	what it was that matched.
	* Support for highlighting the matched feature in yellow.  Highlighted
	feature is persistent across sessions (may annoy people - consider
	a selectable option)
	* Support for a "highlight" plugin class which will highlight features
	based on matching attributes or other queries.

1.54	Thu Aug 28 12:08:15 EDT 2003
        * Really fixed the security hole that was only partially fixed in 1.53.
	* Fixed the config file associated with the tutorial.
        * Fixed the install scripts so that they work on Windows.
        * Added a patch to allow GBrowse to dump GenBank and EMBL formatted
	files while using BioPerl 1.2.2.
	* Modified GFFDumper to dump GFF from multiple sources, not just
	what is in the primary data source.  This functionality is still
	experimental and not fully tested.
        * Added more complete documentation for using GBrowse with GenBank
        formated files

1.53    Thu Aug 21 14:40:54 EDT 2003
        * Security hole that allowed the display of /etc/passwd and other
	files fixed
