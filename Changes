1.62    Mon Apr  5 09:43:25 EDT 2004
	* Added additional padding to prevent scales of xyplot glyph from being
	cut off.
	* Added ability to search within external annotation files for uploaded
	features.  You will need to CVS update bioperl-live to get this feature.
	* Fixed problem of external annotation files disappearing.
	* Fixed the problem of three-frame translation glyph showing wrong
	translation.  HOWEVER, for the [x]flip feature to work properly, you will
	need to CVS update bioperl-live.
	* Fixed the problem of segments shrinking by 1 bp when the starting
	segment length was an odd number.
	* Fixed problem of gbrowse_img consuming all available memory
	when displaying 3d party features in absolute coordinates.
	* Fixed problem of only one feature being found during wildcard search
	and identically-named matches are on different reference sequences.
	* Fixed problem of track settings disappearing when "update image" is
	pressed when the track checkboxes are hidden.
	* Fixed cross-site scripting bug (security hole) reported by Toshiaki
	Katayama.
	* Added a pairwise_plot glyph for showing linkage disequilibrium,
	paired blast scores, and other pairwise feature data.
	* Use can now turn on and off the overview tracks.
1.61    Wed Mar 17 21:59:16 EST 2004
        * Moved the BioSQL adaptor to 'experimental'.  It is not guaranteed
        to work.
        * Really fixed the landmark problem (the 1.60 release was premature)
	* Quashed warnings from the GeneFinder plugin
	* Suppress warnings generated by coderefs in the link and window_target
	options.  See make_map() to turn this back on - it might not be the 
	greatest idea to turn off warnings

1.60	Tue Mar 16 16:36:45 EST 2004
	* Fixed problem of some landmarks not being recognized using 
	the Class:Name syntax.

        * Fixed bug with link URL when the same feature type occurred in more
        than one track
        * Added SVG "Publication quality image" option; as a result, GD 2.07
        is the minimum version of GD required.
        * Added the ability to modify html display via callbacks utilizing
        segment and page setting objects.
        * Fixed alignment problems in gbrowse_details
        * Fixed several items with the chado/gmod adaptor

	to 
	http://localhost/cgi-bin/gbrowse/yeast
	This will allow restriction by data sources using Apache's standard
	authentication/authorization techniques.
	* Default time for cookie expiration reduced to 7 days.  This will avoid
	issues arising from previous change.
	* Added mechanisms to restrict individual tracks by username and
        password
	or by host, domain, or IP address.
        * Fixed ppm install utility script
        * Updated documentation to reflect the new GET syntax
        * Fixed sequence alignments in gbrowse_details when there are minus
        strand sequences.

1.55
        * Removed hard coded paths in install scripts
	* Auto-open tracks that contain matches to the search term.  This avoids
	nasty behavior in which someone searches for "collagen" and never sees
	what it was that matched.
	* Support for highlighting the matched feature in yellow.  Highlighted
	feature is persistent across sessions (may annoy people - consider
	a selectable option)
	* Support for a "highlight" plugin class which will highlight features
	based on matching attributes or other queries.

1.54	Thu Aug 28 12:08:15 EDT 2003

        formated files

1.47 	Tue Oct  8 14:44:44 EDT 2002
	* Bug fix release.
	* Fixed source sorting so that lowest alphabetically-sorted
	  configuration file is accepted by default.  Otherwise,
	  the default is BioSQL, which is not installed on most
	  machines and causes an internal server error.
	* Fixed the plugins so that they are not turned on by default.
	* Changed the default empty track style from "suppress" to "key."
	* Better error reporting.
	* Changed passwd=>pass in all the sample config files.

	* If you pick up the latest bioperl-live (or apply extras/bioperl-1.0.patch)
	there are fixes in Bio::Graphics that prevent genes from disappearing
	when zoomed all the way into an intron.
1.38	Mon Apr  8 21:16:12 EDT 2002
	* Previous version would crash on vanilla Bioperl 1.0 installations.
