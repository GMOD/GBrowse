This document describes how to install the Generic Genome Browser.

1. PREREQUISITES

GBrowse runs on top of several software packages.  These must be
installed and configured before you can run GBrowse.  Most
preconfigured Linux systems will have some of these packages installed
already.

  A) MySQL -- http://www.mysql.com
	The MySQL database is a fast open source relational database
	that is widely used for web applications.  It is required for
	most real-live genome annotation projects.  For small projects
	(a few thousands of annotated features), you can skip installing
	MySQL and use an in-memory database instead.

  B) Apache Web Server -- http://www.apache.org
	The Apache web server is the industry standard open source
	web server for Unix and Windows systems.

  C) Perl 5.005 -- http://www.cpan.org
	The Perl language is widely used for web applications.
	Version 5.6 is preferred, but 5.00503 or higher will work.

  D) Standard Perl modules -- http://www.cpan.org
	The following Perl modules must be installed for GBrowse to work.
	They can be found on the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network
	(CPAN):

        CGI
	GD
        DBI
        DBD::mysql
	Digest::MD5
	Text::Shellwords

  F) Bioperl version 1.2.2 or higher -- http://www.bioperl.org
     (Note: Use anonymous CVS to get Bioperl 1.2.2 if it isn't
            yet released).

Optional modules:

  G) XML::Parser, XML::Writer, XML::Twig, XML::DOM

   If these modules are present, the "Sequence Dumper" plugin
   will be able to produce GAME and BSML output.  They can be
   downloaded from CPAN.

  H) LWP

  To load remote 3d party annotations.

2. INSTALLING THE BROWSER WITH ACTIVESTATE'S PPM TOOL

Make sure that Apache and a database (MySQL, Oracle or PostgreSQL) are
installed before you start.

Brief synopsis:

	ppm> rep add gmod http://stein.cshl.org/ppm
	ppm> rep up gmod
	ppm> rep up gmod
	ppm> install DBD::mysql
	ppm> install Generic-Genome-Browser

Binary distributions of GBrowse and the 1.2.2 version of Bioperl live at
http://stein.cshl.org/ppm.  Add this repository to the list of active
repositories, and then move the repository to the top to ensure that
you get the most up to date versions of the modules.

If you wish to use a MySQL database, install DBD::mysql if you have
not already done so.  Then install Generic-Genome-Browser.

At the end of the install, the automatic installation script will ask
you to confirm the locations of your Apache conf (configuration),
htdocs (document root) and cgi-bin (CGI executable)
directories. Usually it will guess right, but if it doesn't, just type
in the correct path.

When this is done, go to step (4) below.

3. INSTALLING THE BROWSER FROM SOURCE

Skip this step if you have installed with ActiveState's PPM.

Brief synopsis:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

The last step may need to be done as root.  There is a test defined
for this package, but you must initialize and load a database before
you can run it.

This will install the software in the default location under
/usr/local/apache. See "Details" to change this.

To further configure GBrowse, see docs/CONFIGURE_HOWTO.txt.  To run
GBrowse on top of Oracle and BioSQL databases see
docs/ORACLE_AND_BIOSQL.txt.  To run GBrowse on top of Gadfly, see
README-berkeley-gadfly. To install on Microsoft Windows platforms, see
README-windows.txt.

Details:

The browser consists of a CGI script named "gbrowse", a Perl module
that handles some of the gory details, a small number of static image
files, and a configuration directory that contains configuration files
for each data source.  By default, these will be installed in the
following locations:

   CGI script:      /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/gbrowse
   Static images:   /usr/local/apache/htdocs/gbrowse
   Config files:    /usr/local/apache/conf/gbrowse.conf
   The module:	    -standard site-specific Perl library location-

You can change change the location of the installation by passing
Makefile.PL one or more NAME=VALUE pairs, like so:

  perl Makefile.PL CONF=/etc HTDOCS=/home/html

This will cause the configuration files to be installed in
/etc/gbrowse.conf and the static files to be installed in
/home/html/gbrowse.

The following arguments are recognized:

  CONF		  Configuration file directory
  HTDOCS	  Static files directory
  CGIBIN	  CGI script directory
  INSTALLSITELIB  Perl site-specific modules directory
  PREFIX	  Base directory for conf, htdocs and cgibin

For example, if you are on a RedHat system, where the default Apache
installation uses /var/www/html for HTML files, /var/www/cgi-bin for
CGI scripts, and /etc/httpd/conf for the configuration files, you
should specify the following configuration:

  perl Makefile.PL HTDOCS=/var/www/html \
	           CONF=/etc/httpd/conf \
		   CGIBIN=/var/www/cgi-bin

(The backslashes are there to split the command across multiple lines
only). To make it easier when upgrading to new versions of the
software, you can put this command into a shell script.

As a convenience, you can use the configuration option PREFIX, in
which case the static and CGI files will be placed into PREFIX/conf,
PREFIX/htdocs and PREFIX/cgi-bin respectively, where PREFIX is the
location you specified:

  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/www

Note that the configuration files are always placed in a subdirectory
named gbrowse.conf.  You cannot change this.  Similarly, the static
files are placed in a directory named gbrowse.  The install script
will detect if there are already configuration files in the selected
directory and not overwrite them if so.  The same applies to the
cascading stylesheet file (gbrowse.css) located in the gbrowse
subdirectory.  However, neither the GIF files in the "buttons"
subdirectory nor the plugin modules in the gbrowse.conf/plugins
directory are checked before overwriting them, so be careful to copy
the new copies somewhere safe if you have modified them.

You can always manually move the files around after install.  See
docs/configuration.txt for details.

When installing the static files, the install script also creates an
empty directory named "tmp".  This directory is set to be world
writable so that the GBrowse server can use it to manage temporary image
files that it creates on the fly.  If you would prefer not to have a
world writable directory on your system, simply change the ownership
and permissions to allow the web server account to write into it.  The
directory is located in /usr/local/apache/htdocs/gbrowse/tmp by
default.

The first time you run Makefile.PL, a file named GGB.def will be
created your file path settings.  When Makefile.PL is run again, it
will ask you whether you wish to use the 

4. TRY THE BROWSER OUT

The installation procedure will create a small in-memory database of
yeast chromosome 1 for you to play with.  To try the browser out, use
your favorite browser to open:

 http://localhost/cgi-bin/gbrowse

Try searching for "I" (the name of the first chromosome of yeast), or
a gene such as NUT21 or TCF3.  Then try searching for "membrane
trafficking."

For your interest, the feature and DNA files for this database is
located in the web server's document root at
gbrowse/databases/yeast_chr1.  The configuration file is in the web
server's configuration directory under gbrowse.conf/yeast1.conf.

More configuration information and a short tutorial are located at:

  http://localhost/gbrowse

5. POPULATING THE DATABASE (MySQL)

This step takes you through populating the database with the full
yeast genome.  You can skip this step if you use the in-memory
database for small projects (see section 6).

Synopsis:

  mysql -uroot -p password -e 'create database yeast'

  mysql -uroot -p password -e 'grant all privileges on yeast.* to me@localhost'
  mysql -uroot -p password -e 'grant file on *.* to me@localhost'
  mysql -uroot -p password -e 'grant select on yeast.* to nobody@localhost'

  bp_bulk_load_gff.pl -d yeast sample_data/yeast_data.gff
  make test

Details:

Note for RedHat Linux users: note that if you are using the default installed
Apache, the user that apache runs as is 'apache' as opposed to the otherwise
standard 'nobody'.  Therefore, everywhere 'nobody' occurs in these directions,
replace it with 'apache'.

You will need a MySQL database in order to start using GBrowse.  Using the
mysql command line, create a database (called "yeast" in the synopsis
above), and ensure that you have update and file privileges on it.
The example above assumes that you have a username of "me" and that
you will allow updates from the local machine only.  It also gives all
privileges to "me".  You may be comfortable with a more restricted set
of privileges, but be sure to provide at least SELECT, UPDATE and
INSERT privileges.  You will need to provide the administrator's name
and correct password for these commands to succeed.

In addition, grant the "nobody" user the SELECT privilege.  The web
server usually runs as nobody, and must be able to make queries on the
database.  Modify this as needed if the web server runs under a
different account.

The next step is to load the database with data.  This is accomplished
by loading the database from a tab-delimited file containing the
genomic annotations in GFF format.  The Bioperl distribution comes
with three tools for loading Bio::DB::GFF databases:

  1) bp_load_gff.pl
     This will incrementally load a database, optionally initializing
     it if it does not already exist.  This script will work correctly
     even if the MySQL server is located on another host.

  2) bp_bulk_load_gff.pl
     This Perl script will initialize a new Bio::DB::GFF database with
     a fresh schema, deleting anything that was there before.  It will
     then load the file.  Only suitable for use the very first time
     you create a database, or when you want to start from scratch!
     The bulk loader is as much as 10x faster than bp_load_gff.pl, but
     does not work in the situation in which the MySQL database
     is running on a remote host.

  3) bp_fast_load_gff.pl
     This will incrementally load a database.  On UNIX systems, it will
     activate a fast loader that makes the speed almost the same as
     the bulk loader.  Be careful, though, because this is an experimental
     piece of software.

You will find these scripts in the Bioperl distribution, in the
subdirectory scripts/Bio-DB-GFF.  Earlier versions of the
distribution will have these files directly in the scripts/
subdirectory.  

For testing purposes, this distribution includes a GFF file with yeast
genome annotations.  The file can be found in the test_data
subdirectory.  If the load is successful, you should see a message
indicating that 13298 features were successfully loaded.

Provided that the yeast load was successful, you may now run "make
test".  This invokes a small test script that tests that the database
is accessible by the "nobody" user and that the basic feature
retrieval functions are working.

You may also wish to load the yeast DNA, so that you can test the
three-frame translation and GC content features of the browser.
Because of its size, the file containing the complete yeast genome is
distributed separately and can be downloaded from:

  http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gmod/yeast.fasta.gz?download

Load the file with this command:

  bp_load_gff.pl -d yeast -fasta yeast.fasta.gz </dev/null

(or, if you are on a windows system:

  bp_load_gff.pl -d yeast -fasta yeast.fasta.gz

 and hit ^Z when the script pauses.)

You should now be able to browse the yeast genome.  Type the following
URL into your favorite browser:

  http://name.of.your.host/cgi-bin/gbrowse?source=yeast

This will display the genome browser instructions and a search field.
Type in "III" to start searching chromosome III, or search for
"glucose" to find a bunch of genes that are involved in glucose
metabolism.

*IF YOU GET AN ERROR* examine the Apache server error log (depending
on how Apache was installed, it may be located in
/usr/local/apache/logs/, /var/log/httpd/, /var/log/apache, or
elsewhere).  Usually there will be an informative error message in the
error log.  The most common problem is MySQL password or permissions
problems.

6. LOADING OTHER DATA SETS

Genome feature tables for the major model organisms and human can be
found at www.gmod.org in the downloads section, but these files are
not guaranteed to be up to date.

Each model organism database has its own flat file format for
representing the data.  For the most up to date information, you
should download these files and process them into GFF format.
Currently, all of the model organism databases require some tweaking
of the flat files, but the bioperl distribution includes several small
perl scripts to make this easier.  These scripts are optionally
installed when you install Bioperl.  You'll find them in the bioperl
scripts/Bio-DB-GFF directory if you didn't install them directly.

They are:

  bp_process_gadfly.pl     For FlyBase D. melanogaster flat files
  bp_process_ncbi_human.pl For human annotations from NCBI
  bp_process_sgd.pl        For SGD S. cerevisiae flat files
  bp_process_wormbase.pl   For WormBase C. elegans flat files

Run the script with the -h option to get some data-specific help:

  % bp_process_gadfly.pl -h

The bp_process_wormbase.pl script requires the AcePerl package, which
is available from CPAN.  It is not strictly necessary to run this
script because the unaltered GFF files distributed from WormBase are
compatible with GBrowse.  bp_process_wormbase.pl supplements the
information with the physical positions of genetic markers, GenBank
accession numbers and functional descriptions of gene products.

For configuration files that will work with each of these databases,
look in contrib/conf_files (or in
http://localhost/gbrowse/contrib/conf_files).  Simply copy the
appropriate configuration file into your gbrowse.conf directory, and
edit the database name as appropriate.

You might also be interested in the load_genbank.pl script, which is
installed when you install GBrowse.  You can give this script a list
of Genbank or EMBL accession numbers and it will automatically
download the indicated entries and load them into a MySQL
database. You can also load flat files in Genbank or EMBL format.

The sample configuration file 08.genbank.conf (located in
contrib/conf_files) is appropriate for data loaded with
load_genbank.pl.

7. LOADING DNA

To display the DNA sequence and to run sequence-dependent glyphs such
as the three-frame translation, you will need to load the DNA as well
as the annotations.  The DNA must be formatted as a series of one or
more FASTA-format files in which each entry in the file corresponds to
a top-level sequence such as a chromosome pseudomolecule.  You can
then run the bp_load_gff.pl or bp_bulk_load_gff.pl script using the -fasta
argument.  For example, if the yeast genome is contained in a FASTA
file named yeast.fa, you would run the command:

  bp_bulk_load_gff.pl -d yeast -fasta yeast.fa sample/yeast_data.gff

Alternatively, you may put several FASTA files into a directory, and
provide the directory name as the argument to -fasta.

(The yeast DNA is too large to be included in this distribution, but
you can get a copy of it from
ftp://genome-ftp.stanford.edu/pub/yeast/)

Run "bp_bulk_load_gff.pl -h" to see usage instructions.

8. CREATING YOUR OWN GENOME DATABASE

See the file doc/configuration.txt for information on how to create
new databases from scratch, add new browser tracks, and how to get the
browser to dump the DNA from the region currently under display.

9. MAKING THE BROWSER RUN FASTER

Three factors are major contributors to the length of time it takes to
load a gbrowse page:

  1) loading the Perl interpreter and parsing BioPerl and all the 
     other Perl libraries that gbrowse uses.

  2) query speed on the database

  3) the conversion at the Perl layer of database data into BioPerl
  objects for rendering.

To improve (1), I recommend that you install the mod_perl module for
Apache. (http://perl.apache.org).  By configuring an Apache::Registry
directory and placing gbrowse inside it (rather than in the default
cgi-bin directory). The overhead for loading Perl and its libraries
are eliminated, thereby increasing the performance of the script
noticeably.

Be aware that there is a bad interaction between the Apache::DBI
module (often used to speed up database accesses) and Bio::DB::GFF.
This will cause the GFF dumper plugin to fail intermittently.  GBrowse
does not need Apache::DBI to achieve performance increases under
mod_perl and it is suggested that you disable Apache::DBI.  If you
cannot do this, then you should remove the file GFFDumper.pm from the
gbrowse.conf/plugins directory.

Database query performance (2) is also a major factor.  If you are
using MySQL as the backend, you will see dramatic performance
increases by increasing the amount of memory available to the key
buffer, sort buffer, table cache and other in-memory data structures.
I suggest that you replace the default MySQL configuration file
(usually stored in /etc/my.cnf) with one of the large-memory sample
configuration files provided in the support-files subdirectory of the
MySQL distribution.  Of course, if you tell MySQL to use more memory
than you have, then performance will degrade again.

Finally, there is a slowdown when gbrowse converts the results of
database SQL queries into renderable biological objects.  This becomes
particularly noticeable when there are lots of multi-segment objects
to be displayed.  You can work around this slowdown by using semantic
zooming (see docs/CONFIGURE_HOWTO.txt).  Otherwise, there's not much
that can be done about this short of buying a faster machine.
The GMOD team is working hard to reduce this performance hit.

10. MAKING THE BROWSER RUN SAFER

Whenever you are running a server-side Web script using information
provided by a web client, there is a risk that maliciously-formatted
data provided by the use will trick the server-side script into
performing some unintentional action, such as modifying a file on the
server.  Perl's "taint" checks are designed to catch places in the
code where such malicious data could cause harm, and GBrowse has been
tested extensively with these taint checks activated.  

Because of taint checks' noticeable impact on performance, they have
been turned off in the distributed version of gbrowse.  If you wish to
reactivate the extra checking (at the expense of a performance hit),
go to the file "gbrowse" located in the Web scripts directory and edit
the top line of the file to read:

  #!/usr/bin/perl -w -T

The -T switch turns on taint checks.

If you are running GBrowse under mod_perl, add the following line to
the httpd.conf configuration file:

  PerlTaintCheck  On

This will affect all mod_perl scripts globally.

10. BIOPERL VERSIONS

GBrowse is evolving quickly, and some of its features are dependent on
new features in Bioperl 1.2.2.  If you are having trouble making
GBrowse run, make sure you are using Bioperl 1.2.2!  If Bioperl 1.2.2
is not released by the time you read this, you'll need to use
Anonymous CVS to obtain it.  Full instructions are given at
http://www.bioperl.org

11. THE GBROWSE_IMG SCRIPT

The gbrowse_img CGI script (a new feature as of version 1.41), is a
stripped-down version of gbrowse which just generates images.  It is
suitable for incorporating into <img> tags in order to make a
thumbnail of a region of interest.  The thumbnail can then be linked
to the full-featured gbrowse.  Here is an example of how this works
using the WormBase site:

  <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/seq/gbrowse?source=wormbase;name=mec-3">
    <img src="http://www.wormbase.org/db/seq/gbrowse_img?source=wormbase;name=mec-3;width=200">
  </a>

This will generate a 200-pixel inline image of the region.  Clicking
on the image will link to the fully-navigable gbrowse script.

You can also use gbrowse_img to superimpose temporary features (like
BLAST hits) on the existing genome features.

Read docs/gbrowse_img.txt for the CGI parameters and other
instructions. A copy of these instructions in HTML form will be
generated when gbrowse_img is called without any arguments.  Type
http://your.host/cgi-bin/gbrowse_img into your favorite web browser.

12. PLUGINS

Gbrowse has a plugin architecture which makes it easy for third-party
developers to expand its functionality.  The plugins are Perl .pm
files located in the directory gbrowse.conf/plugins/.  To install
plugins, simply copy them into this directory.  To uninstall, remove
them.

If you wish to install your own or third party plugins, it is
suggested that you create a separate directory outside the
gbrowse.conf/ hierarchy in which to store them and then to indicate
the location of these plugins using the plugin_path setting:

  plugin_path = /usr/local/gbrowse_plugins

This setting should be somewhere in the [GENERAL] section of the
relevant gbrowse configuration file.

13. THE GENBANK/EMBL PROXY

Sample configuration number 5 ("05.embl.conf") corresponds to an
experimental pass-through proxy for Genbank.  At least in theory, if
you enter a landmark that isn't recognized, gbrowse will go to EMBL
using the bioperl BioFetch facility, parse the record, and enter it
into the local database.  This allows you to browse arbitrary
Genbank/EMBL/Refseq entries.

You are free to experiment with this, but don't expect it to be
entirely reliable.  To get it to work, you must:

   a) make sure you are using Bioperl 1.02 (or a patched version of
   1.01)

   b) create a local database named "embl" 

   c) set up permissions for this database so that "nobody@localhost"
	has SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE privileges

   d) initialize the database for use with this command:
	
	bp_load_gff.pl -c -d embl </dev/null

	(if you are on a windows system, just leave out the </dev/null)

   e) if you need to use a proxy to access remote web sites, uncomment the
	-proxy line in the 05.embl.conf file, and adjust the URL of the proxy as 
	appropriate.

   f) go to http://localhost/cgi-bin/gbrowse?source=embl
	Search for a Genbank or embl accession number, such as CEF58D5

14. UPDATING THE BROWSER WITHOUT REENTERING YOUR DIRECTORY SETTINGS

When updating GBrowse to a new version of the software, you can
configure it using your preferred directory settings by making a
backup copy of the file GGB.def that was generated the first time you
installed GBrowse and using `cat GGB.def` as the argument to
Makefile.PL.  Here is the recipe:

  cp Generic-Genome-Browser-1.40/GGB.def Generic-Genome-Browser-1.41/GGB.def
  cd Generic-Genome-Browser-1.41/
  perl Makefile.PL `cat GGB.def`
  make
  make install

15. KNOWN BUGS

Currently there is one known bug.  The navigation buttons do not
operate properly when the client is using Internet Explorer 5.1 on a
Macintosh and accessing gbrowse running on a MacOS X server running
Apache.  Other combinations of clients and servers work properly.

16. FEATURE WISH LIST (updated June 6, 2003)

 - Full DAS support.
 - A glyph for representing cytogenetic maps.

If you are interested in working on any of these features, please
contact the developers at the address given in the next section.

15. SUPPORT AND BUG REPORTS
