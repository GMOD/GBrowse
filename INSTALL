This document describes how to install the Generic Genome Browser
(GGB).

1. PREREQUISITES

GGB runs on top of several software packages.  These must be installed
and configured before you can run it.  Most preconfigured Linux
systems will have some of these packages installed already.

  A) MySQL -- http://www.mysql.com
	The MySQL database is a fast open source relational database
	that is widely used for web applications.

  B) Apache Web Server -- http://www.apache.org
	The Apache web server is the industry standard open source
	web server for Unix and Windows systems.

  C) Perl 5.005 -- http://www.cpan.org
	The Perl language is widely used for web applications.
	Version 5.6 is preferred, but 5.00503 or higher will work.
	

  D) Standard Perl modules -- http://www.cpan.org
	The following Perl modules must be installed for GGB to work.
	They can be found on the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network
	(CPAN):

	GD
        DBI
        DBD::mysql
	Digest::MD5
	Text::Shellwords

  E) Bio::DB::GFF module -- http://www.bioperl.org
	This is the middleware layer that translates between
	the CGI script to the database.  It is part of the
	bioperl package.

  F) Bio::Graphics module -- http://www.gmod.org
	This is the module that renders the information in the
	database into graphics.  It is part of the GMOD project
	and can be downloaded from the same location you got this
	package.

2. INSTALLING THE BROWSER

Brief synopsis:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

The last step may need to be done as root.  There is a test defined
for this package, but you must initialize and load a database before
you can run it.

This will install the software in the default location under
/usr/local/apache. See "Details" to change this.

Details:

The browser consists of a CGI script named "gbrowse", a Perl module
that handles some of the gory details, a small number of static image
files, and a configuration directory that contains configuration files
for each data source.  By default, these will be installed in the
following locations:

   CGI script:      /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/gbrowse
   Static images:   /usr/local/apache/htdocs/gbrowse
   Config files:    /usr/local/apache/conf/gbrowse.conf
   The module:	    -standard site-specific Perl library location-

You can change change the location of the installation by passing
Makefile.PL one or more NAME=VALUE pairs, like so:

  perl Makefile.PL CONF=/etc HTDOCS=/home/html

This will cause the configuration files to be installed in
/etc/gbrowse.conf and the static files to be installed in
/home/html/gbrowse.

The following arguments are recognized:

  CONF		  Configuration file directory
  HTDOCS	  Static files directory
  CGIBIN	  CGI script directory
  INSTALLSITELIB  Perl site-specific modules directory
  PREFIX	  Base directory for conf, htdocs and cgibin

For example, if you are on a RedHat system, where the default Apache
installation uses /var/www/html for HTML files, /var/www/cgi-bin for
CGI scripts, and /etc/httpd/conf for the configuration files, you
should specify the following configuration:

  perl Makefile.PL HTDOCS=/var/www/html \
	           CONF=/etc/httpd/conf \
		   CGIBIN=/var/www/cgi-bin

(The backslashes are there to split the command across multiple lines
only). To make it easier when upgrading to new versions of the
software, you can put this command into a shell script.

As a convenience, you can use the configuration option PREFIX, in
which case the static and CGI files will be placed into PREFIX/conf,
PREFIX/htdocs and PREFIX/cgi-bin respectively, where PREFIX is the
location you specified:

  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/www

Note that the configuration files are always placed in a subdirectory
named gbrowse.conf.  You cannot change this.  Similarly, the static
files are placed in a directory named gbrowse.  The install script
will detect if there are already configuration files in the selected
directory and not overwrite them if so.  The same applies to the
cascading stylesheet file (gbrowse.css) located in the gbrowse
subdirectory.  However, the GIF files in the "buttons" subdirectory
are not checked before they are overwritten, so be careful to copy the
new copies somewhere safe if you have modified them.

You can always manually move the files around after install.  See
docs/configuration.txt for details.

When installing the static files, the install script also creates an
empty directory named "tmp".  This directory is set to be world
writable so that the GGB server can use it to manage temporary image
files that it creates on the fly.  If you would prefer not to have a
world writable directory on your system, simply change the ownership
and permissions to allow the web server account to write into it.  The
directory is located in /usr/local/apache/htdocs/gbrowse/tmp by
default.


3. POPULATING THE DATABASE

Synopsis:

  mysql -uroot -p password -e 'create database yeast'

  mysql -uroot -p password -e 'grant all privileges on yeast.* to me@localhost'
  mysql -uroot -p password -e 'grant file on *.* to yeast@localhost'
  mysql -uroot -p password -e 'grant select on yeast.* to nobody@localhost'

  bulk_load_gff.pl -d yeast sample_data/yeast_data.gff
  make test

Details:

You will need a MySQL database in order to start using GGB.  Using the
mysql command line, create a database (called "yeast" in the synopsis
above), and ensure that you have update and file privileges on it.
The example above assumes that you have a username of "me" and that
you will allow updates from the local machine only.  It also gives all
privileges to "me".  You may be comfortable with a more restricted set
of privileges, but be sure to provide at least SELECT, UPDATE and
INSERT privileges.  You will need to provide the administrator's name
and correct password for these commands to succeed.

In addition, grant the "nobody" user the SELECT privilege.  The web
server usually runs as nobody, and must be able to make queries on the
database.  Modify this as needed if the web server runs under a
different account.

The next step is to load the database with data.  This is accomplished
by loading the database from a tab-delimited file containing the
genomic annotations in GFF format.  The Bioperl distribution comes
with two tools for loading Bio::DB::GFF databases:

  1) bulk_load_gff.pl
     This Perl script will initialize a new Bio::DB::GFF database with
     a fresh schema, deleting anything that was there before.  It will
     then load the file.  Only suitable for use the very first time
     you create a database, or when you want to start from scratch!

  2) load_gff.pl
     This will incrementally load a database, optionally initializing
     it if it does not already exist.  This script is slower, but it
     allows incremental loading.

You will find these scripts in the Bioperl distribution, in the
subdirectory scripts/Bio-DB-GFF.  Earlier versions of the
distribution will have these files directly in the scripts/
subdirectory.  

For testing purposes, this distribution includes a GFF file with yeast
genome annotations.  The file can be found in the test_data
subdirectory.  If the load is successful, you should see a message
indicating that 13298 features were successfully loaded.

Provided that the yeast load was successful, you may now run "make
test".  This invokes a small test script that tests that the database
is accessible by the "nobody" user and that the basic feature
retrieval functions are working.

4. TESTING THE BROWSER

You should now be able to browse the yeast genome.  Type the following
URL into your favorite browser:

  http://name.of.your.host/cgi-bin/gbrowse?source=yeast

This will display the genome browser instructions and a search field.
Type in "III" to start searching chromosome III, or search for
"glucose" to find a bunch of genes that are involved in glucose
metabolism.

5. LOADING OTHER DATA SETS

Each model organism database has its own flat file format for
representing the data.  This package includes three small perl scripts
that massage the model-specific annotation files into GFF format
suitable for loading:

  process_gadfly.pl     For FlyBase D. melanogaster flat files
  process_sgd.pl        For SGD S. cerevisiae flat files
  process_wormbase.pl   For WormBase C. elegans flat files

You will find the scripts, along with information on downloading the
current model organism files, in the bin subdirectory of this package.
The scripts will also have been copied into your system binaries
directory when you made "install".  Run the script with the -h option
to get some data-specific help:

  % process_gadfly.pl -h

The process_wormbase.pl script requires the AcePerl package, which is
available from CPAN.  It is not strictly necessary to run this script
because the unaltered GFF files distributed from WormBase are
compatible with GGB.  process_wormbase.pl supplements the information
with the physical positions of genetic markers, GenBank accession
numbers and functional descriptions of gene products.

6. CREATING YOUR OWN GENOME DATABASE

See the file doc/configuration.txt for information on how to create
new databases from scratch, add new browser tracks, and how to get the
browser to dump the DNA from the region currently under display.

7. MAKING THE BROWSER RUN FASTER

If you have mod_perl (http://perl.apache.org), you can install the
gbrowse script as an Apache::Registry script.  This will increase the
performance of the script noticeably.  

Be aware that there is a bad interaction between the Apache::DBI
module (often used to speed up database accesses) and Bio::DB::GFF.
This will result in the GFF dump feature failing intermittently.  GGB
does not need Apache::DBI to achieve performance increases under
mod_perl and it is suggested that you disable Apache::DBI.

Have fun!
