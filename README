The Generic Genome Browser (GBrowse) is a simple but highly
configurable web-based genome browser.  It is a component of the
Generic Model Organism Systems Database project (GMOD).

******* WARNING ******

The HEAD of CVS (including this file) is undergoing rapid change and
is not stable. Do not use this version of GBrowse unless you are
actively developing it. Either use one of the released tarballs, or
check out the "stable" cvs branch:

 cvs -d pserver:anonymous@gmod.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gmod login
 cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@gmod.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gmod co -r stable Generic-Genome-Browser

You have been warned!!!
