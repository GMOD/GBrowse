IMPORTANT NOTE: Between version 1.01 and 1.02 there was a change in
the Bio::DB::GFF module which will invalidate 1.01 (and earlier)
databases.  Specifically, the DNA can now be stored inside the MySQL
database rather than in external FASTA files.  This is a big
administrative improvement.  To upgrade your database without
reloading the data, follow these steps:

  1) connect to the database using mysql and run this command
        drop table fdna

  2) run the following command using the load_gff.pl script from
     Bio::DB::GFF 1.01:

          load_gff.pl --upgrade --database <your database>

If the script complains that the --upgrade option is not recognized,
you do not have Bio::DB::GFF 1.01.  Get a more recent version of
bioperl.
