If you have SELinux installed, typically as part of Fedora Core 3 or
4, then you may experinece difficulties getting GBrowse to work.  The
default security parameters for SELinux prevent GBrowse from
performing some fundamental tasks, including reading its configuration
file in $CONF/gbrowse.conf (where $CONF is typically /etc/httpd/conf
or /usr/local/apache/conf).  While we are working the developers of
SELinux to fix this, here are the directions for the current work
around:

1. Make sure your security policy is up to date:

  % yum update selinux-policy-targeted

2. Open System Settings->Security Level and click on the SELinux tab.
Click on the HTTPD Service triangle to get the httpd settings, and
select "Disable SELinux protection for httpd daemon".

2a. Alternatively, uncheck "Enforcing" to set the enforcement level
to permissive.

After you do this, add the --SELINUX=1 tag when exectuting perl Makefile.PL:

  % perl Makefile.PL --SELINUX=1

Please let me know if you have any difficulties with this procedure.
