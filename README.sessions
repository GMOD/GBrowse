This version of gbrowse (branch gbrowse-session) replaces the big
cookies previously used to save state with server-side files and a
single small cookie containing an ID. Using this version of gbrowse
will avoid problems with MS Internet Explorer when the cookies become
too big or numerous (symptom: the plugins stop working properly).

The only known disadvantage of this version is that you must install
CGI::Session.
