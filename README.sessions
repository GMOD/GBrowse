This version of gbrowse (CVS branch "gbrowse-session") replaces the
obese cookies previously used to save state with server-side session
files and small cookies that contain a short ID. This version of
gbrowse will avoid problems with MS Internet Explorer when the cookies
become too big or too numerous (major symptom: plugins stop working).

The only known disadvantage of this version is that you must install
the CGI::Session module. See CONFIGURE_HOWTO for information on how to
fine-tune the session handling behavior (look for "session driver" and
"session args").
