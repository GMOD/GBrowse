* there are still some reports of disappearing features, that we thought
was fixed with modifications to the MySQL adaptor.  If you experince
'disappearing' features (that is, features that are visible at one zoom
level and disappear (not as a result of sematic zooming) when the zoom
level is changed slightly), please report it to us at the GBrowse mailing
list and report the circumstances under which it occurs.

test change for cvs

* Add popup menu support using Cyril's code and overlib/overlibmws.
* More internationalization
