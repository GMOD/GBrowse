* Better workaround for MSIE broken cookie handling.  When moving from
  datasource to datasource, the section visibility toggle will change
  haphazardly rather than being reset to the previous value.  This will be
  noticeable within the track section.
* More internationalization
* Limit search results to user-set max
* Group SVG elements by feature ID
* Get rid of verbs attached to plugin names so that translations work properly.
  Will need plugin authors to provide internationalization.
* Colorize xyglyph.
