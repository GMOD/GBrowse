=head1 NAME

auto_install_databases.pl - Download and install GFF data sets

=head1 SYNOPSYS

  % auto_install_databases.pl --rdms pg --user scott

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program queries a web server to determine what data sets are
available and presents the user with a list to choose from, with the
option of getting several data sets at once.  The chosen data sets 
are downloaded and they are used as inputs for the bulk loader of the
specified relational database management system (either MySQL or 
PostgreSQL) to initialize and load the GFF and optionally fasta
data.

=head2 NOTES

This program uses the bulk loader for its database (bp_bulk_load_gff.pl
for mysql, bp_pg_bulk_load_gff.pl for postgres); read the documentation
for those programs for caveats with their use.
                                                                                 
Like the bulk loaders, this program uses \$TMPDIR to transiently store
downloaded data, therefore, \$TMPDIR must have enough free space to store
all of the raw data and the processed files for importation to the database.
                                                                                 
To create your own web server data source, carefully copy the syntax and
file structure of the default data source, as this program is very
inflexible with regard to the obtaining information from the web server.
                                                                                 
Since the data is being downloaded uncompressed from web server, it may
take a very long time for the download and database load to complete.
An hour or more is not out of the question for a large data set like
wormbase.

=head1 COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS

Options can be abbreviated.  For example, you can use -s for --server.

    --server           URL of web server to obtain datasets
                         Default = 'http://brie4.cshl.org:8000/'
    --rdms             RDMS to use (mysql or pg (Postgres))
                         Default = 'mysql'
    --user             Username to log into database server as
                         Default = ''
    --password         Password associated with username
                         Default = ''
