By default, the GBrowse2 scripts will be installed in a subdirectory
named /cgi-bin/gb2 in order to avoid conflicting with older
installations. The gbrowse_karyotype and gbrowse_syn scripts have been
removed for the time being because they need to be updated to be
compatible with the new architecture.

GBrowse2 can be most easily run by setting the following environment
variables under Apache:

PER5LIB         -- path to perl libraries
GBROWSE_CONF    -- path to GBrowse config files  (/etc/GBrowse2)
GBROWSE_DOCS    -- physical path to htdocs       (/var/www/gbrowse2)
GBROWSE_ROOT    -- URL for gbrowse root          (/gbrowse2)
GBROWSE_MASTER  -- name of the gbrowse conf file (GBrowse.conf)
