The TextDumper plugin was contributed by Don Jackson.  It provides a
report on features in the active region as a tab-delimited text file.
It's based on the GFFDumper, but adds a few tweaks for
user-friendliness:

  - only features from the active tracks are displayed

  - the configuration page lets users select which attributes
  (reference, start, stop, notes, etc) are displayed

  - users can select a mime type for the report.  Currently the plugin
  supports text/plain or application/vnd.ms-excel

To install, copy TextDumper.pm to your plugins directory, stored
underneath your web server configuration directory at
gbrowse.conf/plugins.  Then add TextDumper to plugins line in the
appropriate gbrowse.conf configuration file.
