This is a sample init script for the GBrowse rendering slave. You can
run one or more copies of this daemon on network attached systems in
order to generate tracks in parallel on separate machines. In theory
this will make rendering much faster.


This init script was written for Ubuntu, but will probably work on
other Debian and possibly RedHat systems.  Place it in /etc/init.d,
and then create a link to it from the desired rc*.d directory.

Copy etc/default/gbrowse-slave into /etc/default/gbrowse-slave, then
customize it for your system.

To start the slave run:

  /etc/init.d/gbrowse-slave start

To stop it:

  /etc/init.d/gbrowse-slave stop

The default is to log to /var/log/gbrowse/gbrowse_slave.
