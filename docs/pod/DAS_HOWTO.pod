=head1 USING GBROWSE AS A DAS SERVER & CLIENT

The Distributed Annotation System (DAS; www.biodas.org) is a simple
protocol for sharing and integrating genomic annotations.  GBrowse can
act both as a DAS front end for visualization and as a DAS server for
sharing your annotations.

You will need to install the Perl Bio::Das module before you can use
any of the DAS features.  This module is available from CPAN
(L<http://www.cpan.org>), or via the ActiveState PPM tool.

=head2 CONFIGURING GBROWSE TO BE A DAS SERVER

At installation time, the "das" CGI script was installed in your
CGI-BIN directory.  This script is the core of the GBrowse DAS server.
None of the GBrowse databases on your system are initially available
as DAS sources until you explicitly activate them by adding the "das
mapmaster" option to the configuration file.  Similarly, none of the
tracks in a given database are exported as DAS-available tracks until
you explicitly add a "das category" option to the track configuration
stanza.  Together these two features allow you to select which
databases will be exported as DAS-accessible databases, and which
tracks within a DAS-accessible database will be visible to the outside
world.

The following DAS-specific options are recognized:

=over 4

=item das mapmaster

This option, which should appear somewhere in the [GENERAL] section,
indicates that the database should be made available as a DAS source.
The value of the option corresponds to the URL of the DAS reference
server for this data source, or "SELF" if this database is its own
reference server.  (See http://www.biodas.org/ for an explanation of
what reference servers are.)

Examples:

	das mapmaster = SELF

	das mapmaster = http://www.wormbase.org/db/das/elegans

=item das category

This option must appear in each of the track configuration stanzas
that you wish to export as DAS-accessible data.  Note that it is not
sufficient to define a das category in the [TRACK DEFAULTS] section.
The value of this option should be one of:

    repeat
    transcription
    translation
    variation
    experimental
    structural
    miscellaneous

which correspond to "DAS annotation type categories" as explained on
the DAS web site.

=item das landmark

If this option appears in a track configuration stanza and is set to a
true value (any non-zero value) then the DAS server will treat the
features in this track as landmarks and allow remote users to search
for these features by using their class and name.

=item das subparts

If this option appears in a track configuration stanza and is set to a
true (non-zero) value, then the DAS server will indicate that features
of this type contain subparts of a genome assembly.  This relationship
can be used to indicate that a contig contains reads, for example.
This option is only used for reference servers that serve genomic
assemblies and B<is not well tested> so should probably be avoided for
now.

=item das superparts

If this option appears in a track configuration stanza and is set to a
true (non-zero) value, then the DAS server will indicate that features
of this type are themselves superparts of a genome assembly.  This
relationship can be used to indicate that a read feature is contained
in a contig.  This option is only used for reference servers that
serve genomic assemblies and B<is not well tested> so should probably
be avoided for now.

=item das flatten

If this option is set to true, then multipart features, such as genes,
will be flattened into their lowest level subparts (e.g. exons). This
is needed to get some features to display correctly on the Ensembl
contig browser. Example:

 das flatten = 1

=item das glyph

By default the stylesheet generated by your DAS server will specify
that the DAS browser use the same glyph as specified by the "glyph"
option. However, not all servers support all GBrowse glyphs. Use "das
glyph" to force the glyph to one of the standard DAS glyphs.  Example:

 das glyph = box

=item das type

Some servers (e.g. Ensembl) reserve special behaviors for certain
feature types, such as "GENE". Use "das type" to force the type
reported for all features in the track. Example:

 das type = GENE

=back


=head2 CONFIGURING GBROWSE TO BE A DAS CLIENT

GBrowse can run as a DAS client as well, either on a track-by-track
basis, or by configuring GBrowse to run entirely off a DAS
source. However, because of a poorly characterized interaction between
the Bio::Das module and Perl 5.6, it is recommended that you use Perl
5.8.1 or higher for this. Otherwise you may experience out of memory
errors.

You can display individual DAS tracks in GBrowse just by typing in the
URL of a DAS server in the "Add remote annotations" section of the
GBrowse main web page.  The syntax of the URL is simple - some examples:

=over 4

=item http://www.wormbase.org/db/das/elegans/features?segment=I

Insert all features of C. elegans chromosome I

=item http://www.wormbase.org/db/das/elegans/features?segment=I:1000,2000

Insert all features of a given segment of C. elegans chromosome I.

=item http://www.wormbase.org/db/das/elegans/features?segment=I:1000,2000;category=SAGE_tag:SAGE_tag_genomic_unique

Insert all unique SAGE tags from the given segment of chromosome I.

=item http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/das/hg18/types

Insert all known types in human genome build 18.

=back

You may wish to use the "remote sources" option to preconfigure a
popup menu of remote DAS servers that users access frequently.

Alternatively, you can configure GBrowse so that it runs entirely off
a DAS server.  To do this, simply set the db_adaptor and db_args
options to use the Bio::Das data adaptor.  For example:

 [GENERAL]
 description   = Human July 2003 Genome at UCSC
 db_adaptor    = Bio::Das
 db_args       = -source http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/das
	         -dsn    hg16

The db_args option expects a -source argument that points to the base
of the DAS server, and a -dsn argument that points to the data source
name.

You will also need to configure a track for each of the feature types
served by the remote DAS server. You can get a list of such feature
types simply by fetching the following form of DAS URL:

      http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/das/hg16/types

Alternatively, to make your life more convenient, GBrowse comes with a
utility script called make_das_conf.pl that will create a
rough-and-ready configuration file for you, given the URL and data
source name of a DAS server.  Instructions on using make_das_conf.pl
can be found using the "perldoc" command:

   % perldoc make_das_conf.pl

After generating the config file, you will probably want to customize
it.  Particularly in need of customization are typically the glyphs
used in the track definitions, and the aggregators.
