=item When I search, why doesn't GBrowse find my 3-letter gene name?

If you are using the MySQL GFF adaptor and are storing gene names
inside Note attributes, then you may bump up against MySQL's default
four-letter limit on full text searches. To fix this, either:

  1. Put the gene name in an Alias attribute, e.g. "Alias LEP"

or

  2. Change MySQL to allow searches on 3-character words.

The latter solution is a multi-step process:

  1. Open /etc/my.cnf and add the following configuration line
     to the [mysqld] stanza:

         ft_min_word_len=3

  2. Restart the mysql server.

  3. Connect to your database using the mysql command-line client
     and run the command:

         mysql> repair table fattribute_to_feature quick;

=item Why are there so few questions in the FAQ?
