=head1 Using gbrowse with GadFly

In order to get gbrowse to work with the GadFly database and API we
hacked the gbrowse script considerably, making it use GadFly objects
and gadFly API calls. We have committed the code in a seperate branch,
called "berkeley-gadfly". To use this version of gbrowse with GadFly,
check out this branch, and get the GadFly database and perl modules -
see http://www.fruitfly.org/developers/

We hope to eventually merge the branches, and use an adapter bridge to
transparently connect to GadFly.  The gadfly adaptor located in the
lib directory is incomplete and nonfunctional.
