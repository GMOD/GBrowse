=head1 Support for the chado database schema

Note that I consider chado support experimental still, as I am the only 
person that I know of who has tested it.

The chado schema ( http://www.gmod.org/schema ) is a comprehensive database
schema developed largely by developers at UC Berkeley and Harvard working
on FlyBase.  It is intended to be a generic database schema for model
organism use.  Its use with GBrowse is supported via a limited implementation
of the Das interface from BioPerl.  It is limited in that I implemented 
only what I needed of the interface and nothing more.

The chado adaptor works through three perl modules included in this 
distribution:

  lib/Bio/DB/Das/Chado.pm
  lib/Bio/DB/Das/Chado/Segment.pm
  lib/Bio/DB/Das/Chado/Segment/Feature.pm

These files are installed the in the BioPerl infastructure when 'make install' 
is run.

A sample chado configuration file is included in contrib/conf_files/.  
Since chado uses the Sequence Ontology for its controlled vocabulary, it
is quite likely that this configuration file should work for any
instance of chado once the database-specific parameters are set.

If you encounter any bugs or problems with this chado adaptor, please
let me know.
