=head1 NAME

Bio::Graphics::FeatureFile::Iterator -- Iterator across a Bio::Graphics::FeatureFile

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Bio::Graphics::FeatureFile;
 my $data  = Bio::Graphics::FeatureFile->new(-file => 'features.txt');
 my $iterator = $data->get_seq_stream;
 while (my $feature = $iterator->next_seq) {
   print $feature->display_id,"\t",$feature->start,"\t",$feature->end,"\n";
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a Bio::SeqIO-like object that recognizes the next_seq() and
next_feature() methods.  The two methods are synonymous.

There is also a rewind() method which will start iterating from the
beginning again.
