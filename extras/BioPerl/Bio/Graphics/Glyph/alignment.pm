=head1 NAME

Bio::Graphics::Glyph::alignment - The "alignment" glyph

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  See L<Bio::Graphics::Panel> and L<Bio::Graphics::Glyph>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is identical to the "graded_segments" glyph, and is used for
drawing features that consist of discontinuous segments.  The
color intensity of each segment is proportionate to the score.

                 strandedness

In addition, the alignment glyph recognizes the following
glyph-specific options:

  Option      Description                  Default
  ------      -----------                  -------

  -max_score  Maximum value of the	   Calculated
              feature's "score" attribute

  -min_score  Minimum value of the         Calculated
              feature's "score" attribute

If max_score and min_score are not specified, then the glyph will
calculate the local maximum and minimum scores at run time.
