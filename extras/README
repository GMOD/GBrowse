The BioPerl directory contains the versions of the Bioperl
Bio::Graphics and Bio::DB::GFF libraries that were current as of May
28, 2005.  These correct a number of minor bugs in Bioperl version
1.4, plus add Sequence Ontology compatibility.  They are installed
automatically if Makefile.PL detects that you are running Bioperl 1.4
or earlier.

Do not install these files if you are running Bioperl 1.5 or higher.
