<H1>Adding Annotations to the Genome</H1>

<P>You can upload your own list of sequence annotations to this page
and view them in the context of the genome.  Uploaded annotations will
persist until you edit them or delete them.  Your annotations are
private and will not be seen by other individuals.  If you choose to,
you can publish your annotations and share them with your
colleagues.</P>

<p>

<A NAME="upload"></A>
<h2>To upload annotations:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Create a text file using the format described below.  The file
      must be <i>text only</i>.
  <li>Use the <b>Browse...</b> button to select the file.
  <li>Press the <b>Upload</b> button to upload the file.
</ol>

<p>

The browser should now show a line of text that identifies the date
you uploaded this file, and links to the sequence(s) which you have
annotated:

<blockquote>
<font color="blue"><u>[your_file.txt]</u></font> <i>Last modified Mon Dec 17 08:43:36 2001. Annotated sequences:</i>
<font color="blue"><u>T22A3</u></font>
</blockquote>

<P>From now on, whenever you browse a region covered by your
annotations they will appear on the display. To quickly go to an
annotated region, click on its link.  (If your file contains too many
annotated regions they will not be shown as individual links.)</p>

<hr>
<a name="edit"></a>
<h2>To edit annotations:</h2>

<p>

Your annotations will persist until you delete them, or until they are
not accessed for a long period of time, typically 60 days.  To modify
them, you can upload a new file, replacing the old one.
Alternatively, you can edit them on-line.

<p>

<ol>
  <li>Press the <b>Edit Data...</b> button. This will display a text field containing
      your uploaded annotations.
  <li>Make the changes you want.

<h2>Annotation File Format</h2>

<p>

For quantitative data (such as microarray expression levels), please
use <a
href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/google/goldenPath/help/wiggle.html">"WIG"
format</a>.

</p>

For qualitative data, use the simple "Feature File format" described
here, or the <a href="http://www.sequenceontology.org/gff3.shtml">GFF3
format</a> Annotation files must be saved as <b>text only</b>.  Here
is an example of Feature File format:

<blockquote>
<pre>
[mRNA]
glyph = gene
key   = My Genes

mRNA hox1 Chr1:1..100 Type=UTR
mRNA hox1 Chr1:101..200,300..400,500..800 Type=CDS
mRNA hox1 Chr1:801..1000 Type=UTR

[EST]

</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Data Lines</h3>

<p>

Each annotation occupies one or more lines.  It contains three to five
columns, delimited by tabs or spaces:

<dl>
  <dt><b>Column 1, the feature type</b>
  <dd>The first column is the feature type.  Any description is valid,
      but a short word, like "knockout" is better than a long one, like
      "Transposon-mediated knockout".  Later on you can provide a long descriptive
      name in the formatting key if you desire.  If the feature type contains white
      space, you must surround it by double or single quotes.
  <dt><b>Column 2, the feature name</b>
  <dd>This is the name of the feature.  The name will be displayed
      above the feature when there's room for it and name display is turned on.
      Shorter names are more attractive than long ones.  If the name contains white space, you must
      surround it by white space.  Use empty quotes ("") if there is no name to display.
  <dt><b>Column 3, the feature position</b>
  <dd>The third column contains one or more ranges occupied by the
      feature.  A range has a sequence ID indicating the chromosome, contig or other reference sequence
      on which the feature resides, plus a start and end position, and is expressed either as
      "seqID:start..stop" or "seqID:start-stop".  Use whichever form
      you prefer. You can express a feature that occupies a discontinuous set of ranges, such as an mRNA
      aligned to the genome, by providing a list of ranges separated by commas.  Example:
      <blockquote><pre>
      chr3:1..10,49..80,110..200
      </pre></blockquote>
      There should be no spaces before or after the commas.  If there are, enclose the entire range
      in quotes.
      <p>
      To describe an oriented feature that is on the minus strand, such as a transcribed gene,
      simply reverse the order of the start and stop ranges.  For example:
      <blockquote><pre>
      chr1:200..110,80..49,10..1
      </pre></blockquote>
      The strandedness is only displayed when using an arrowhead glyph, such the "transcript" glyph
      or the generic glyph  with the <b>strand_arrow=1</b> option.  See <a href="#formatting">Customizing the display</a>
      for details.
      <p>
      All ranges uses the coordinate system of the most recently declared reference landmark.
  <dt><b>Column 4, Tags</b> [optional]
  <dd>The fourth column, if present, is treated as a description.  The description will be printed at the
      bottom of the feature.  If there is no description, either leave blank, or use empty quotes.  If there
      is whitespace in the description, surround it with quotes.  You can also enter <i>attribute=value</i>
      information here for processing by certain glyphs.  The combinations you are likely to use currently
      are <i>URL=http://some.place</i> to indicate a URL to link to, <i>Note="some note"</i> to provide a descriptive
      caption to print under the feature, <i>Score=XXXXX</i> (where <i>XXXX</i> is some numeric value)
      to give the feature a score for those glyphs that chart numeric values, and <i>Type="some type"</i>
      to create genes and other complex multipart features.
      <p>
      See
      <a href="#customize">Customizing the display</a> for details.
</dl>

<p>

If most of your features are on the same chromosome, then you can
insert a <i>reference=&lt;seqid&gt;</i> line to indicate the default
sequence ID:

<blockquote>
<pre>
reference=Chr1
PRED	"Gene 1"	518..616 score=50
PRED    "Gene 1"        661..735 score=80
PRED    "Gene 1"        3187..3365 score=50
PRED	"Gene 2"	16626..17396 score=85
PRED    "Gene 2"        17451..17597 score=90
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>

Chr1 will now be the default chromosome until the next
<i>reference=</i> line is encountered.

<p>

In addition to this format, you may use the standard GFF format for
your data.  Details can be found <a
href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Users/rd/gff.html">at the Sanger
Centre</a>.

<h3>Features and Subparts</h3>

<p>

To create a feature that has multiple subparts, you can indicate the
type of each subpart using the <i>Type="some type"</i> tag. Usually
you will use this for coding gene transcripts when you want to
distinguish the coding and non-coding portions of the gene.

<p>

Here is a simple example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
mRNA B0511.1   Chr1:1..100                     Type=UTR;Note="Putative primase"
mRNA B0511.1   Chr1:101..200,300..400,500..800 Type=CDS
mRNA B0511.1   Chr1:801..1000                  Type=UTR
</pre>

The top level feature's primary tag will be "mRNA", as indicated in the first column.
It will contain five subparts, a 5' UTR spanning positions 1..100, a series of three
CDS (coding) regions, and a 3' UTR extending from positions 801..1000.

<p>

Additional tags that are placed in the first line of the feature, such
as the Note, will be applied to the top level. In this example, the
note "Putative primase" will be applied to the mRNA at the top level
of the feature:

<h3>Grouping</h3>

<p>

You can group related features together.  The layout will attempt to
keep grouped features together, and will connect them with a dotted or
solid line if the <b>connector</b> option is specified.

<p>

A group is created using a line that contains just two columns
consisting of the feature type and name.  This is followed by a series
of data lines in which the feature type is blank.  For example:

<blockquote>
<PRE>
cDNA-clone  yk53c10
            yk53c10.5       18892-19154
            yk53c10.3       15000-15500,15700-15800

[cDNA-clone]
glyph = segments
connector = dashed
</PRE>
</blockquote>

<P>

This example creates a group of type "cDNA-clone" named Yk53c10.  It
consists of two sub-features, one the 5' EST and the other the 3'
EST.  The two configuration section that follows this group says to
use the "segments" glyph and to connect the parts using a dashed
line.  This is described in more detail later.

<p>

You can add URLs and descriptions to the components of a group, but
not to the group as a whole.


<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>

You can place a comment in the annotation file by preceding it with a
pound sign (#).  Everything following the pound sign is ignored:

<blockquote><pre>
# this is a comment
</pre></blockquote>

<hr>

<A NAME="customize"></a>
<H2>Customizing the Display</H2>

<P>

The browser will generate a reasonable display of your annotations by
default.  However, you can customize the appearance extensively by
including one or more configuration sections in the annotation file.
In addition to changing the size, color and shape of the graphical
elements, you can attach URLs to them so that the user will be taken
to a web page of your choice when he clicks on the feature.
<p>

Here is an example configuration section.  It can appear at the top of
xthe file, at the bottom, or interspersed among data sections:

<blockquote>
<pre>
 # example file
 [general]
 height = 12
 strand_arrow = 1

 [EST]
 glyph = segments
 bgcolor= yellow
 connector = dashed
 height = 5

 [FGENES]
 glyph = gene
 bgcolor = green
 description = 1
</PRE>
</blockquote>

<P>

The configuration section is divided into a set of sections, each one
labeled with a <b>[section title]</b>. The <b>[general]</b> section
specifies global options for the entire image. Other sections apply to
particular feature types. In the example, the configuration in the
<b>[EST]</b> section applies to features labeled as having type "EST",
while the configuration in the <b>[FGENES]</b> section applies to
features labeled as predictions from the FGENES gene prediction
program. Options in more specific sections override those in the
general section.</P>

<P>Inside each section is a series of <b><i>name</i>=<i>value</i></b>
pairs, where the name is the name of an option to set. You can put
whitespace around the = sign to make it more readable, or even use a
colon (:) instead if you prefer. The following option names are
recognized:</P>

	 three panels.  <p>
	 "details" is the default.
     </td>
     <td>details+overview</td>
  </tr>

</table>

<P>The bump option is the most important option for controlling the look
of the image. If set to false (the number 0), then the features are
allowed to overlap. If set to true (the number 1), then the features
will move vertically to avoid colliding. If not specified, bump is
turned on if the number of any given type of sequence feature is
greater than 50.</P>

<p>

Unlike the data section, you do not need to put quotes around option
values that contain white space.  In fact, you can continue long
option values across multiple lines by putting extra space in front of
the continuation lines:

<blockquote><pre>
[GenomeAlign]
citation = The pseudoobscura genome was aligned to melanogaster using
   GenomeAlign version 1.0.  High-similarity regions are shown in
   blue, low similarity regions are shown in orange.  The work was
   performed by Joe Postdoc, and is currently in press.
</pre></blockquote>

<p>

Some glyphs also have glyph-specific options.  These are described in
detail below.

    in the configuration stanza, and the start and ending hues are indicated
    by "start_color" and "end_color." A feature with score equal to min_score will
    be displayed using start_color, while a feature with score equal to max_score
    will be displayed using end_color. Intermediate scores are displayed by blending
    the two hues.

<H2><a name="numeric">Displaying Intensity Plots &amp; Other Numeric Data</a></H2>

<p>


You can upload microarray intensity data sets and other numeric data.
The plot of the data will be displayed as a histogram or line chart
superimposed on the genomic annotations.

<p>

Here is a simple template for you to follow. The result is shown on
the right.

<p>


The [expression] section says to use the xyplot type of glyph, to set
its type to "boxes" (a column chart), to make the fore and background
colors black and red respectively, to set the height of the chart to
100, and to set the minimum and maximum values for the Y axis to 0 and
110 respectively.  We also add a label and a human-readable track key.

<p>


The data section defines two experiments to show in the track.  Both
experiments use probes whose positions are relative to landmark B0019
(you can of course use chromosome coordinates, or whatever you
choose).  Both experiments are of type "expression", but one is the
"liver" experiment and the other is the "kidney" experiment, as
indicated in the second column.  The third column contains the
coordinates of each assay point, and the fourth column contains the
score=XXX attribute, where XXX is the intensity value.

<p>

See the <a href="#glyph_specific">chart in the previous section</a>
for the xyplot glyph options.

<H2><A NAME="remote">Publishing Annotations</A></H2>

<p>

If you have access to a web server, you can easily publish your
annotations.  Simply take the annotation data file and place it on a
Web server that is accessible to the Internet (or at least to the
server on which the Genome Browser runs).

<p>

Type the URL of your annotation file into the <b>Enter remote track URL</b>
text field of the genome browser screen.  Your
annotation file be will accessed by the web server on which the genome
browser runs, loaded and displayed.  Repeat this process to add more
external annotation tracks to the display.  To remove a URL, just
delete the contents of the field.

<p>
