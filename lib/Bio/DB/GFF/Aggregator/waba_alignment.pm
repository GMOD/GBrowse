=head1 DESCRIPTION

Bio::DB::GFF::Aggregator::waba_alignment handles the type of
alignments produced by Jim Kent's WABA program, and was written to be
compatible with the C elegans GFF files.  It aggregates the following
feature types into an aggregate type of "waba_alignment":

   similarity:waba_weak
   similarity:waba_strong
   similarity:waba_coding
