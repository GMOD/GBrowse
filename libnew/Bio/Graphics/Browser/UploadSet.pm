=head1 NAME

Bio::Graphics::Browser::UploadSet -- A set of uploaded feature files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

None.  Used internally by gbrowse & gbrowse_img.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item $upload_set = Bio::Graphics::Browser::UploadSet->new($config,$state)

Initialize uploaded files according to the configuration and page
state.  Returns an object.

=item $conf = $upload_set->config

Returns the configuration object.

=item $state = $upload_set->state

Returns the page state hash

=item $url = $upload_set->upload_file($filehandle)

Given a CGI.pm-style upload filehandle, upload the file to an
anonymous disk file, and return the symbolic trackname URL of the
uploaded file.

=item $url = $upload_set->new_file([$filename])

Create a new empty file with the indicated name and returns its
trackname URL.  If no name is given, one will be generated
automagically.

=item $fh = $upload_set->open_file($url [,$mode])

Attempts to open the URL for reading or writing, depending on the
provided $mode (which is one of ">", "<", ">>", etc).  If successful,
returns the filehandle.

=item $upload_set->clear_file($url)

Clears and unlinks the file.

=item ($url,$path) = $upload_set->name_file($filename)

Given a filename, generates a unique name for it under the user's
temporary upload space.  Returns the trackname URL and a physical path
to the actual file.

=item $upload_set->annotate($segment,$feature_files,$coordinate_mapper)

Annotates the given segment and returns the results in the
$feature_file hash.  The keys of the hash will be set to tracknames
defined in the uploaded files, and the values will be
Bio::Graphics::FeatureFile objects.  The $coordinate_mapper callback
is a code ref to a function that will transform coordinates from
relative to absolute coordinates.  The function takes a reference
sequence name and a list of [$start,$end] coordinate pairs, and
returns a similar function result, except that the sequence name and
coordinates are all in absolute coordinate space.
