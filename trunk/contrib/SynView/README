The files in this directory were supplied by Haiming Wang and
Jessica Kissinger at University of Georgia's Center for Tropical & 
Emerging Global Diseases & Department of Genetics.  There are
two components:

  1. A GUSdb adaptor (DAS::GUS) based on Bio::DB::Das::Chado in this
  distribution.  This adaptor is written to be reasonably generic, and
  so it may be possible to use this as a template for creating an
  adaptor for any database.

  2. A sample configuration file (plasmodb.conf) that is similar to what
  drives the synteny tracks in the gbrowse installation at 
  http://www.plasmodb.org/.  For an example of what the display looks like,
  see http://www.plasmodb.org/cgi-bin/gbrowse/plasmodb/?start=101357;stop=121356;ref=MAL12;width=800;version=100;label=AnnotatedGenes-SyntenySpansVivaxMC-SyntenyGenesVivaxMC

  This synteny view can use any GBrowse data adaptor, including the 
  Bio::DB::GFF and memory adaptors. Note that SynView requires 
  Tie::IxHash.

An example dataset is also included in the MAL11 directory; this directory
contains a GFF3 file, fasta file and a GBrowse configuration file set
up to use the memory adaptor.

This of course is a very brief introduction to SynView, for more
information, please see http://www.apidb.org/apps/SynView/, contact
Jessica or Haiming, or see their paper in Bioinformatics:
